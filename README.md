Web application for finding pick up games happening in your area.

To setup:
download all files into local directory
open the python terminal in that directory
Run command: import * from models.py
Run command: init_db()
This should set up the db and populate it with dummy events

Will try moving this project to pythonAnywhere so that people won't have to download this to see it in action.
